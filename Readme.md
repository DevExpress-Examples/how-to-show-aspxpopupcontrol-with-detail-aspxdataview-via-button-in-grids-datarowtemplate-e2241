# How to show ASPxPopupControl with detail ASPxDataView via button in grid's DataRowTemplate


<p>This demo illustrates how to implement a Master-Detail relationship. The ASPxGridView control (master) contains an ASPxButton control inside the DataRowTempate. When a focus moves to the ASPxButton, the ASPxPopupControl with the ASPxDataView control (details) is shown. The ASPxDataControl is refreshed via a callback of the ASPxCallbackPanel control, which contains this ASPxDataView control.</p>
